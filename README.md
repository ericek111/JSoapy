# JSoapy

Java bindings for [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR), a popular vendor and platform neutral SDR support library.

Partially auto-generated, but mostly hand-crafted to present all original functionality in a more familiar way without sacrificing performance.

Still very much WIP.
